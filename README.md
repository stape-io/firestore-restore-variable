# Firestore reStore Variable for Google Tag Manager Server Container

The **Firestore reStore Variable** for Google Tag Manager Server Container allows you to connect to a Firestore database and dynamically fetch specific documents or collections based on user identifiers. It is ideal for use cases where you need to restore data values in GTM tags, triggers, and variables, particularly in cookieless, cross-device, and cross-site tracking scenarios.

This variable retrieves data from Firestore based on a list of identifiers (such as `user_id` or `client_id`) and restores the parameters specified in the list of the data to be restored.
